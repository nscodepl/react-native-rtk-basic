# Simple usage of Redux Toolkit in React Native

Hi there! We have created a very simple example of usign Redux Toolkit in React Native App.

The app uses simple "counter" slice with actions `increment` and `decrement`. (We hope that they speak for themself).

Learn more at our [blog](https://www.nscode.eu/blog).

## Running the example

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `yarn install`
3. Run `yarn start`

This example uses [Expo](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)
